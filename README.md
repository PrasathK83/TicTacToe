# TicTacToe
This is a simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built for everyone to enjoy! The game supports both classic 3x3 mode and an extended 5x5 mode for more challenge and fun. Two players take turns marking the grid with X and O, and the first to align their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
